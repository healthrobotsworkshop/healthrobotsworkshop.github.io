# HRI-workshop 2026

This Workshop tempalte is based on `sniffle` which is an easy-to-use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme. `sniffle` automates many of the mundane tasks needed for workshop webpages, including:

* curating **speaker** lists
* curating **organizer** lists
* populating **schedule** webpages
* managing a list of **accepted papers**

This template has a different style in Speakers, Organizers and Schedule section.
